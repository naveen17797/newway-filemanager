Newway is a file manager both for servers and for linux distros. Currently, it can perform the functions mentioned in the list above. For added security, this project implements the [jls-login system](https://github.com/naveen17797/jsonLogSys).

## Installation
Newway uses the presence of the `jls-login.json` file to detect whether an email ID and password has been registered. If you forget the email ID or password registered for Newway, the only way to reset it is to delete the `jls-login.json` file (thus deleting the existing registered information). After doing so, you'll be able to register a new email ID and password for Newway.
