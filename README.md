Newway is a file manager for servers, written with PHP. 

## Getting started
Firstly, you will be asked to set up an email and password to access the file manager. 

No need to create a mysql database. Newway runs using a single file. 

## Installation
To install it, just download this repo and place the folder in your root and access it by `https://yourwebsitename/foldername`.

## Troubleshotting
**I can't seem to find my login details**
Newway uses a `users.json` file to record created users. 

Currently, the only way to reset it is to delete the `users.json` file (thus deleting the existing registered information). 

After doing so, you'll be able to register a new email ID and password for Newway.
